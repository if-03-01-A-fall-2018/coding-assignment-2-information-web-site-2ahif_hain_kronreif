    <h1>Communication</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The days of corresponding via telephone and letter writing are not that long ago,<br>
      although in this virtual age such means appear all but antiquated.<br>
      So, have the “good old days” of pen, ink and voice been outdated?<br>
      Well, the answer to this is certainly a resounding “yes” in many cultures and business around the world.<br>
      We now utilise high-speed Internet, fax, VoIP conference calling and the wonders of email.<br>
      However, are these means truly that much different than the days when we used to scribe letters, <br></p>
      <section>
        <h2>Then</h2>
        <p>For most of human history, in order to send a message to someone,<br>
         you needed to physically deliver it. People used to communicate with the help of birds and animals.<br>
         <img src="brieftaube.jpg" height="150px" width="120"><br>
         They used to send letters or messages by training there birds.<br>
         But birds could only travel so far.<br>
         In the 5th century BCE, Persian king Darius the Great built<br>
         the Royal Road to improve communication throughout his large empire.<br><br>

         The first long-distance phone call was made by Alexander Graham Bell to his assistant,<br>
         Thomas Watson, on Aug. 10, 1876, from Brantford to Paris, Ontario.<br>
         Watson would also receive the first transcontinental phone call in 1915,<br>
         where Bell said the same thing he said in 1876.<br><br>

         The invention of the communication medium commonly known as radio, although generally<br>
         attributed to Guglielmo Marconi in the 1890s, spanned many decades, from theoretical<br>
         underpinnings, through proof of the phenomenon's existence, development of technical<br>
         means, to its final use in signalling.<br></p>

        <h2>Now</h2>
        <p>One thing happening in today's current society is communication loss.<br>
          This generation breathes on technology, and without it, mankind will struggle to advance, <br>
          meaning they would potentially have to start back at square one. Despite that, <br>
          this statement takes a giant leap in many directions. With this new technology comes new <br>
          abilities and new things to handle, which can, of course, be a distraction from reality. <br>
          This generation, though, takes technology distraction to a whole new level. <br><br>
          Technology has an enormous impact on today’s society, everywhere you go, <br>
          there will be technology around. In schools, offices, stores, anywhere. <br>
          Though this may seem like a good thing, it actually has more hurting qualities then benefiting.<br></p>
